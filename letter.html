                confident, and my greatest cheerleader. Every moment we've shared, every laugh, every tear, made us
                together into something truly beautiful and unbreakable. Life will continue to throw its rocks , And you
                don’t need to be hard on yourself Okay!? Sharing whatever you’re feeling was never Embarrising Vira
                ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧ You can always come to me and say anything despite of overthinking and second
                thought (just like i always do

                I don't think it's gonna be worse than our high school! Remember how little we talked in our
                highschool!! Ik we got this and we are not kiddos anymore, we understand each other times and we get
                it.. Ik we don’t need to explain everything like before, We have come far and strong and I believe we
