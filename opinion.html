    <p class="ruluko-regular">Happy birthday I made this page cause idk if im gonna forget haha!
        <br>
        So yes🤓☝🏻, Vira this is what i made for you by using my skills and I built this up but, ofc not alone ,
        <br>
        I took AI’s help, cause my skills and knowledge aren’t toptier 😝, But it was so much fun.. I think i started
        this project on 2 JAN and i finished at 19 JAN(uploading not included),
        <br>
        I can’t believe what my imagination made/created, I remember at random day , It was night and suddenly the
        thought came “Let’s make a website for her birthday"
        <br>
        and all of sudden the ideas surrounded me, about adding your favourite stuff and fun activities..
        <br>
        I wrote down my ideas and then I couldn't wait to work on and see the final result..
        <br>
        But I was busy and all worked up , because of my college and since I started my job at that time and also
        <br>
        I had to create and make stuff for you!😥but i could not wait everyday i came i seat and work on it , i stayed
        up for night so i can give the best version of it..

        <br> It improved my skills alot and it was so much fun.. I hope you noticed all the tiny details i added in
        it..This website isn’t perfect,

        <br> but "every imperfection has intention.”
        <br>

        Like adding mic since you loved karaoke that day!Changing Website titles according to the pages
        Creating fits according to places and stuff..
        <br>
        Giving you ‘BACK’ button so u can change fit or place
        Giving you variety in OUTFITS and PLACES cause I by myself love choosing stuff its so fun isn’t it?
        <br>
        Creating all the dialogue by myself
        <br>
        <b>IT IS LIKE EVERYTHING IS WHAT I PLANNED AND DESIGNED BY ME! For U!</b>
        <br>
        Even if this site disappears one day, the reason I made it won’t,And honestly, this is not just a birthday gift.
        It’s a memory.
        <br>

        Something you can come back to and smile at, even on random days.
        I wanted you to feel special, seen, and celebrated not just today,
        <br>
        but every time you open this page.
        So if you’re smiling right now, then this whole journey was worth it. 💖
        <br>
        <b>That’s all.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>
            From my imagination… to my screen… to you.
        </b>
        <br><br><br>
